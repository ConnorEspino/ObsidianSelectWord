# Obsidian Select Word Plugin

![](./README%20Assets/ExampleGif.gif)

This is a simple plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md) that selects the word that is closest to the Text Editor's caret.

There is no default hotkey.
- To change the hotkey, open the Settings dialog, go to the Hotkeys panel and search for "Select word". 
- Alternatively, you can click the + icon next to the plugin's on/off switch in the Community Plugins panel.

This is a very basic solution - I might improve it later.
